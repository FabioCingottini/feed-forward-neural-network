# Feed forward neural network

A basic feed forward neural network implementation in Python.

It uses the sigmoid function as the activation function.

It uses the mean squared error as the cost function.

It uses the gradient descent algorithm to train the network.

## Running the code

Create the python virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
```

Run the virtual environment:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

Install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the code:
```bash
python main.py
```

Exit the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```
